Supplement for Project Topics & More
This supplement is to provide some guidelines that can help you select a proper topic for your Project 3.
Since we have learned many UNIX commands, rules, functions, and shell scripts, I think it will make more
sense to develop something that is related with what we have learned and done for the course work.
Many students proposed to develop some well-known games, calculators or other known applications.
Unfortunately, however, those are not acceptable for this project. First of all, the pythons code for such
applications are widely available on the Internet. Also, they are not so relevant to the UNIX course work.
Here are my suggestions for the topics for you to select which will be more relevant to the UNIX course
work. Using python scripting or python programming, you can
Develop a game that can perform a set of meaningful (not so trivial) UNIX system administration work
interactively upon receiving the useâ€™s requests
Create a similar file tree which you created using B shell script for Project 2
Create an application that executes a group of b-shell scripts which are executing a set of UNIX
commands and generate the final output. The b-shell scripts can be executed in a way that the output
of one b-shell script becomes the input to another b-shell script.
Write a program that reads the input file and search the words, sentences, or any other features in the
input file that satisfy the conditions provided by the user or given as the command line arguments
